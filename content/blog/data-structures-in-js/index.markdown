**Data Structure** is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

#### Importance

+ Code performance
+ Trade offs among different approaches
+ Identifying inefficiencies
+ Interviews

### Factors to consider when designing a data structure

+ Speed - how fast
+ Memory - less memory intensive
+ Readability - more readble code

The problem with *time* facto is that:

+ *different or same machine record different time*
+ *speed might not be precise*

## Big O Notation

It allows us to talk formally how the runtime of an input grows as the input grows.

+ Arithmetic operations are constant
+ Variable assignment is constant
+ Acessing elements in an array(by index) or object (by key) is constant.
+ In a loop, the time complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity or whatever happens inside the loop.
  
**Space Complexity** - refers to how much additional memory is needed to be allocated in order to run the code in our algorithm.

**Time Complexity** - Analyze runtime as the size of the input increases.

**Auxiliary Space** - space required by the algorithm, not including space taken by the input
