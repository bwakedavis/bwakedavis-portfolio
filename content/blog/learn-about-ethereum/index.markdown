**Ethereum** is an open source, public, blockchain based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality that allow building of decentralized applications on the platform.

## Features of Ethereum

+ Supports smart contracts
+ Has a Crptocurrency called *ether*
+ Has Smart Property
+ Supports  DEcentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)

## Pillars of Ethereum

+ **Ethereum Virtual Machine** - serves as the heart of ethereu, architecture and provides computer power.
  
+ **Inter-Planetary-File-System** - *IPFS* serves as a distributed storage unit  for large files being stored on the ethereum network.
  
+ **Wallets/Browsers** - serves as a wallet for storing ether. used to deploy contracts

**Ether** is the value token of ethereum(ETH).
It's used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on ethereum network.
Every time a contract is executed, Ethereum consumes token which is termed as 'gas' to run the computations.

**Gas** is the unit for the amount of computional work done by the computer for one cycle of the contract.
A transaction fee is charged as some amount of ether and is taken from the account balance where the transaction originate.
The more the fee, the higher the chances that the transaction will be picked up faster by the miners for inclusion in the block.
Providing too little gas leads to failed transactions.
**Gas limit** is the maximum amount of gas the contract can use for it's computation.

### Smart Contracts

A **Smart Contract** is a software program on the distributed ledger, allowing an immutable, verifiable and secure record all contract and transactions.

They're digital representation of real world contracts.

#### Properties of Smart Contracts

+ *Autonomous* - the creator doesn't have to participate in the process after deployig the contract.
+ *Auto-sufficient* - contracts are able to collect money, realize transactions, distribute resources, issue and spend funds to allow a large capacity of storage.

#### Advantages of Smart Contracts

+ Faster, simpler and hassle free processes.
+ Secure - data in decentralized registry cannot be easily lost or cyber attacked
+ Pecision - Mistakes are not easily made due to absence of physical forms
+ Reduces settlement time.
+ Low operational overheads and costs.
+ Reduced administration and services cost owing .to automation and ease of compliance and reports.

#### Disadvantages of Smart Contracts

+ Hard to maintain - contracts deployed are immutable so changes in bussiness logic and general bug fixes  become tough.
+ Small community because it's a new field.
  
**Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO)** are organizations that exist entirely on the blockchain and are governed by the protocols.
They're designed to hold onto assets and use a kind of voting to manage their distribution(use peer decision making).
DAO's comprise of a global network of nodes and members that all work together and create a unison to manage the distribution.

#### Types of Ethereum Accounts

+ *External Owned Accounts* - These are owned by people or organizations and controlled by private Keys.
+ *Contract Accounts* - These are autonomous accounts controlled by code.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine

**EVM** is a blockchain-based software platform. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (Dapps).

Contracts written in a smart contract specific language are compiled into *bytecode* which the **evm** can read and execute.

## Decentralized Applications(DApps)

**DApps** are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer to peer network of computers instead of a single computer, and are not controllled by a single authority.

#### Features of DApps

+ Open Sourced.The code is made open source and operates autonomously without any person or group controlling the majority of the tokens
+ Decentralized
+ Use Consensus Mechanism
+ Generates tokens to provide value to their contributing nodes.

#### Adavantages of DApps

+ *Autonomy* - you make the agreement yourself.
+ *Trust* - yourrecords are encrypted on a shared ledger.
+ Backup - your document are duplicated many times over.
+ *Accuracy* - they're sometime kinda slower and expensive but avoid errors that arise from tedious computional work.
  
**Yield Farming** - Earning money on deposit to be given to other people as loans and they payback with interest

**Liquidity mining** - distributing tokens to users of a protocol for doing some tasks

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Applications on the blockchain decentralizing finance, lending and interest earnings

#### Advantages of DeFi

+ Transparency
+ Decentralized
+ Flexibility
+ Free for all
  
#### Disadvantages of DeFi

+ Still in infancy stage
+ Sometime partially centralized

## Non-Fungible Tokens

*NFTs*  are digital assets that represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items. eg songs, tweets

Non-fungible tokens are indivisible  and can't be swapped with the other one.

Fungible tokens can be swapped with others of the same kind

### characteristics of NFTs

+ Indivisible
+ Verifiable
+ Indestructible
+ Unique
+ Provably scarce
+ Transferable easily
+ Guarantee ownership
