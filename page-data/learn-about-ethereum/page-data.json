It allows developers to create decentralized applications (Dapps).</p>\n<p>Contracts written in a smart contract specific language are compiled into <em>bytecode</em> which the <strong>evm</strong> can read and execute.</p>\n<h2>Decentralized Applications(DApps)</h2>\n<p><strong>DApps</strong> are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer to peer network of computers instead of a single computer, and are not controllled by a single authority.</p>\n<h4>Features of DApps</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Sourced.The code is made open source and operates autonomously without any person or group controlling the majority of the tokens</li>\n<li>Decentralized</li>\n<li>Use Consensus Mechanism</li>\n<li>Generates tokens to provide value to their contributing nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Adavantages of DApps</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>*Autonomy * - you make the agreement yourself.</li>\n<li><em>Trust</em> - yourrecords are encrypted on a shared ledger.</li>\n<li>Backup - your document are duplicated many times over.</li>\n<li><em>Accuracy</em> - they’re sometime kinda slower and expensive but avoid errors that arise from tedious computional work.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Understand Ethereum and it's Wide Ecosystem","date":"May 02, 2020","description":"Ethereum is the second most popular blockchain after the one that runs on Bitcoin.
